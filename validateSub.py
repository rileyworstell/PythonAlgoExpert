"""
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of th efirst one.
A subseq of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacenti int the array but that are in the same order as they appear
in the array. For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsdq of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] and so do numbers [2, 4].
